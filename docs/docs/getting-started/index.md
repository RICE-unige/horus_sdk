# Getting Started with HORUS

Welcome to HORUS SDK! This section will guide you through connecting your ROS robots to the HORUS Mixed Reality fleet management system.

## What is HORUS?

HORUS is a **Mixed Reality robot fleet management system** that runs on Meta Quest 3 headsets. It allows operators to:

- **Visualize multiple robots simultaneously** in immersive 3D environments
- **Control robot fleets spatially** through intuitive MR gestures and interfaces
- **Monitor real-time sensor data** with 3D overlays (cameras, LiDAR, telemetry)
- **Coordinate multi-robot missions** with spatial planning and visualization

## How the SDK Works

The HORUS SDK connects your ROS robots to the Quest 3 MR interface:

## Prerequisites

!!! warning "Quest 3 Required"
    HORUS is a **Mixed Reality system** that requires:
    
    - **Meta Quest 3 headset** with HORUS MR app installed
    - **ROS2 Humble** environment for robot connectivity
    - **Python 3.10+** for SDK development
